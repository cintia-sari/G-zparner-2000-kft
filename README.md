## The website is available:

https://cintia-sari.github.io/G-zparner-2000-kft/

## Why I wrote this website:

I am creating their own website for one of my clients. Currently, the final touches are being made in terms of appearance and text.

They wanted a new website to replace the old one. The main idea was a modern, clean one-page website. It was important for them that the main color of their logo, yellow, should also return to the website. That is why the choice was made for the black background color.

## funkcionalitás:

* 
The website has 5 main sections: main page, services, our profile, pictures, contact

* 3 more sections within the connection:
write to us, other, contact information, address

* I have placed a few small animations on the website, which are not disturbing but still make the website attractive, such as:
 * the underline in the navigation menu (this function has been disabled on small screens)
 * when scrolling down, the texts disappear from the initial image and the image is enlarged.
 * write to us in the email sending section
